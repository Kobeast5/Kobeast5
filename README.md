# Hello Hello! I'm Kobe (He/Him).

I'm an up and coming web designer and developer. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new things and gain new experiences!

I don't have too much here at the moment. There are just a couple of repositories I made for school assignments. I'm also working on updating my portfolio website. Personally, I feel that my current site doesn't represent the quality of work that I can output. Besides, I made it before I learned about GitHub ðŸ˜…, so I want to show my process as I'm working on my site.
